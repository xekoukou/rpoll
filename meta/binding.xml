			     Name is the public struct to be used by Rust. c_name is the name 
			     of the c_struct or the name of the raw pointer to that struct.
                             An "_t" is added at the end. Opaque is the struct that doesn't 
                             have info about its internal memory structure. need_malloc is used
                             to show whether the struct itself needs allocation in rust.
                             need_dealloc is used to show whether the c struct has pointers that need deallocation as well.
